# Hangman
Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.
This project was done while taking Angela Yu's 100 days of code course.
Feel free to try it out and i hope you guess the word correctly : https://replit.com/@Lat33fah/Day-7-Hangman-5-Start?v=1
